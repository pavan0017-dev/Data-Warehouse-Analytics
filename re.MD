# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! üöÄ  
This project is a comprehensive, hands-on demonstration of building a modern data warehouse and analytics solution-from ingesting raw data to generating actionable business insights. I completed this project as a guided learning experience, following best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The project implements the Medallion Architecture, featuring **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleanses, standardizes, and normalizes data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready, star-schema-modeled data for reporting and analytics.

## üöÄ Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective:**  
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data for analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications:**

- Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
- Integrate both sources into a single, user-friendly data model for analytics.
- Focus on the latest dataset only; historization is not required.
- Provide clear documentation of the data model for both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

**Objective:**  
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

- Customer Behavior
- Product Performance
- Sales Trends

These analytics empower stakeholders with key business metrics for strategic decision-making.
